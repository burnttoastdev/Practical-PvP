# Practical PvP

Want **balenced, more effective PvP** on your server? Practical PvP delivers. This data pack brings essential balance changes by adding **combat logging**, making ender pearls non-stackable, and making elytra's useless. 

These features create a more enjoyable experience for everyone as players can fight without the worry of the other player leaving in the middle of combat and by allowing players to use other modes of transportation rather than the elytra.

## Key Features

* **Ender Pearl Rework:** Non-stackable, only drops from endermen.
* **Elytra Replacement:** A useless, unbreakable leather chestplate.
* **Combat Logging:**
    * A combat timer (30 second default) that is trigger when you hit or get hit by another player. Leaving before waiting out the combat timer will result in getting killed upon rejoining.
    * Server-wide chat announcement when someone dies to combat logging.
    * Timer on the hotbar showing how long until it's safe to log out.

## Customize Combat Time

As an operator, you can customize the duration of the combat timer by running the following command:

```
/scoreboard players set .config timer_seconds <seconds>
```
